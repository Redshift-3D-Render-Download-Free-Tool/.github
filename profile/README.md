## 📌 About the Software
**Redshift 3D Render** is a production-grade GPU renderer designed for artists and studios that demand speed and uncompromising quality. It delivers powerful biased rendering with precise control over sampling, materials, and global illumination.

## ❓ What is Redshift?
Redshift is a fully featured, GPU-accelerated renderer optimized for modern hardware. It supports a wide range of host applications and offers advanced shaders, displacement, volumetrics, and post-effects — enabling photorealistic results even on complex scenes.

## ✅ Why Choose Redshift 3D Render?
- GPU-accelerated path-traced rendering  
- Integrations for Cinema 4D, Maya, 3ds Max, Blender, Houdini  
- Out-of-core rendering for massive scenes  
- Supports multiple GPUs for parallel performance  
- Advanced shading and material system  
- Global illumination, caustics, and subsurface scattering  
- Fast interactive previews and production-ready outputs  

## ⚙️ Key Features
- Physically accurate lighting and reflections  
- Redshift material node network with complex shaders  
- AOVs and multi-pass compositing support  
- Volume rendering, fog, and atmospheric scattering  
- Hair/fur, motion blur, and depth of field rendering  
- Post-effects: bloom, glare, tone mapping, and LUTs  
- Render view with progressive sampling and region render  
- Network rendering and command-line batch options  
- Integration with render managers and pipelines

## 🖥️ System Requirements
- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)  
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA compute capability 6.0 or higher  
- Latest NVIDIA drivers  
- 8 GB RAM (minimum), 16 GB recommended  
- 2 GB VRAM (minimum), 8 GB recommended  
- Supported DCC host application (Cinema 4D, Maya, etc.)

## ▶️ Usage
1. Install **Redshift 3D Render** and enable the plugin for your DCC.  
2. Assign Redshift as your render engine.  
3. Build materials with the Redshift node editor.  
4. Configure lighting, cameras, and passes.  
5. Render interactively or start a batch render for final output.
